# NotebookLM Detector

A simple tool to detect whether an audio file was generated by [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/).

At [Listen Notes](https://www.listennotes.com/), we've encountered a growing number of spammers submitting fake, 
NotebookLM-generated podcasts to our platform. 

We hoped the NotebookLM team would provide a tool to help detect NotebookLM-generated audio. 
However, after a week of back-and-forth emails, we lost patience.

It's now Friday (Oct 4, 2024), and since we won't hear back from the NotebookLM team until next week,
we decided to put together this simple script. Luckily, it seems to work!

## Detection

### Install Dependencies

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Detection Script

To detect whether an audio file is AI-generated or human-produced, run the following command:
```shell
$ python notebooklm_detector.py --action predict --file_path [filename].mp3
```

Youâ€™ll see output like this:
```shell
$ The audio is: AI Generated
```
or
```shell
$ The audio is: Human
```

## Training the Model

You can train the model and regenerate `model.pkl` by following these steps:

### Step 1: Organize the Dataset

* Place NotebookLM-generated audio files (mp3, wav, or mp4) in the datasets/ai/ folder.
* Place human-produced audio files in the datasets/human/ folder.

### Step 2: Run the Training Script

To train the model, run:
```shell
$ python notebooklm_detector.py --action train --dataset_path datasets
```
